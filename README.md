🐸 Frog Jump Path Generator

It is an interactive puzzle game where a frog must find a valid path across a grid, jumping through all the nodes — but each node can only be visited once!The generator is used for finding the validate path.

📘 Overview

The Frog Jump Game is a fun and challenging application designed to help a frog navigate a grid by discovering a valid sequence of jumps. The generator is used for finding the validate path.Users can customize the game by configuring grid size, selecting jumpable nodes, and setting the frog’s starting position and initial direction.
The software visually calculates and displays a valid path, teaching logical thinking and pathfinding concepts in an engaging way.

🕹 Game Rules
1. Starting Point & Initial Direction
The frog begins at a chosen starting node and jumps in the initially set direction (up, down, left, or right).
2. Free Movement After First Jump
After the first jump, the frog can move freely to any neighboring node (up, down, left, or right).
3.One-Time Visit Per Node
Each node can only be visited once during a single game session. The frog must find a path that covers all selected nodes without revisiting any of them.
